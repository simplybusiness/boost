# Boost

FIXME: description

## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Development Setup

You will need to have a Postgresql instance running.  There is a Procfile
to help with this if you want to run Foreman, but you need to run `initdb`
before it starts

    initdb -D var/postgresql




## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    $ java -jar boost-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
