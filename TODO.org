# TO DO

* authentication (google openid connect)
** DONE authomatic.oidc
- acts as middleware
- handles /login/provider/redirect 
- needs an http library to do exchange-token-for-code
- passes other requests through to next handler, after augmenting the
request to include authn details
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect#authenticatingtheuser
** DONE connect google authentication to local subscriber record
- authentications table has iss, sub, subscriber-id, display-name 
and a json field for all the other crap
- change the domain functions to use subscriber-id instead of handle

** TODO set hd param, check hd claim
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect#authenticationuriparameters
** review https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-05.html


* commenting:
** DONE add comments
** DONE view comments
** edit comments? nope, add another


* TODO edit proposal
** add 'status' field
** change description
** change status (open/completed/withdrawn)

* deploy
** DONE plausible dev deploy
** TODO hide the postgres password
** DONE find out why we're writing empty log lines
- need to change "request" to something else
** live deploy

** DONE draw picture of proposal lifetime
- it is proposed
- it may be edited
- one or more people express an interest
- n times { one or ore of those people demonstrate their solution }
- the proposer (and ideally also sponsors) agree it is completed
(how does this work with more than one sponsor?  discussion may 
happen but easiest to say that the others delegate to the proposer)
- if e.g. the work is superseded by events the proposer may withdraw it
- any options for actual integration with kudosh platform?

can someone who has not expressed interest do a demo?  I don't see why not


* make it look prettier
* email notifications or RSS or webhooks or something
* personal profile page
** what they've done
** what they're interested in
** what they've sponsored
