# TO DO

* authentication (google openid connect)
** DONE authomatic.oidc
- acts as middleware
- handles /login/provider/redirect 
- needs an http library to do exchange-token-for-code
- passes other requests through to next handler, after augmenting the
request to include authn details
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect#authenticatingtheuser
** DONE connect google authentication to local subscriber record

and a json field for all the other crap
- change the domain functions to use subscriber-id instead of handle
